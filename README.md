Updating the Application
Adding or Updating Products
Edit the data/products.json file to add new products or update existing ones:

Open the file:
bashCopynano data/products.json

Add a new product by adding a new JSON object to the "products" array:
jsonCopy{
  "id": "24",
  "name": "NEW PRODUCT NAME",
  "brand": "BRAND NAME",
  "category": "category-name",
  "step": "step-name",
  "price": 25.00,
  "priceCategory": "mid",
  "size": "50ml",
  "imageUrl": "img/products/product-name.jpg",
  "retailerLinks": [
    {"name": "Retailer", "url": "https://www.example.com/product-link"}
  ],
  "ingredients": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
  "keyIngredient": "main active ingredient",
  "goodFor": ["skin-type1", "skin-type2", "concern1"],
  "avoidFor": ["skin-type-to-avoid"],
  "description": "Product description goes here."
}

Save the file (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter) and refresh the web application

Adding Product Images

Recommended image size: 300x300 pixels, JPG format
Example command to add an image:
bashCopycp /path/to/your/image.jpg ~/blindwatchmaker/img/products/

You can also replace placeholder icons with your own images:
bashCopy# Example: replacing a skin type icon
cp /path/to/your/icon.svg ~/blindwatchmaker/img/icons/skin-types/dry.svg


Modifying the User Interface
To change the layout or appearance:

Edit the index.html file for structural changes:
bashCopynano index.html

Edit the css/styles.css file for styling changes:
bashCopynano css/styles.css

Edit the js/app.js file for behavior changes:
bashCopynano js/app.js


CSS Customization Tips
Color scheme variables are defined at the top of the CSS file and can be easily modified to change the app's appearance:
cssCopy:root {
  --primary-color: #a5dde6;       /* Main theme color */
  --primary-dark: #7fcad5;        /* Darker version of theme color */
  --secondary-color: #f2c9e1;     /* Accent color */
  --secondary-dark: #e6a5ce;      /* Darker accent color */
  --neutral-light: #f5f6ff;       /* Background color */
  --neutral-medium: #e0e2f0;      /* Medium neutral color */
  --neutral-dark: #333740;        /* Dark text color */
  --text-dark: #333740;           /* Primary text color */
  --text-light: #6b7280;          /* Secondary text color */
}
Adding or Modifying App Sections
To add a new section to the app:

Add HTML markup in index.html:
htmlCopy<section id="new-section" class="hidden-section">
  <h2>New Section Title</h2>
  <div class="new-section-content">
    <!-- Your content here -->
  </div>
  <button id="back-btn-new" class="secondary-btn">Back</button>
</section>

Add CSS for styling in css/styles.css:
cssCopy.new-section-content {
  /* Your styles here */
}

Add JavaScript in js/app.js to handle navigation:
javascriptCopyconst newSectionBtn = document.getElementById('new-section-btn');
const newSection = document.getElementById('new-section');
const backBtnNew = document.getElementById('back-btn-new');

newSectionBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  currentSection.classList.remove('active-section');
  currentSection.classList.add('hidden-section');
  newSection.classList.remove('hidden-section');
  newSection.classList.add('active-section');
});

backBtnNew.addEventListener('click', function() {
  newSection.classList.remove('active-section');
  newSection.classList.add('hidden-section');
  previousSection.classList.remove('hidden-section');
  previousSection.classList.add('active-section');
});


Deployment Options
Local Use Only
Simply run the app with the included local server:
bashCopy./serve.sh
Public Deployment
To make the app available online:

Sign up for a free Netlify account at netlify.com
From the Netlify dashboard, choose "New site from Git" or drag and drop your blindwatchmaker folder
Follow the prompts to deploy your site
Your app will be live at a URL like yoursitename.netlify.app

Alternatively, use GitHub Pages:

Create a GitHub repository
Push your blindwatchmaker directory to the repository
Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
Your app will be available at https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/

Maintenance
Updating the Product Database
Schedule regular updates to keep the product database current:

Review and update product pricing
Add new popular products to the database
Remove discontinued products
Update product links if retailers change their URLs

Backing Up Your Data
It's good practice to create backups of your customized files:
bashCopy# Create a backup directory
mkdir -p ~/blindwatchmaker-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Copy important files
cp ~/blindwatchmaker/data/products.json ~/blindwatchmaker-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
cp ~/blindwatchmaker/css/styles.css ~/blindwatchmaker-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
cp ~/blindwatchmaker/js/app.js ~/blindwatchmaker-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
cp ~/blindwatchmaker/index.html ~/blindwatchmaker-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
Improving App Performance
For better performance:

Compress images using a tool like ImageOptim
Minify CSS and JavaScript files for production
Use a CDN for hosting in production environments

Troubleshooting

Images don't appear: Check that image paths in products.json match the actual filenames in img/products/
Server won't start: Make sure the serve.sh file is executable: chmod +x serve.sh
Products don't appear in recommendations: Verify that their properties (category, goodFor) match user selections
App doesn't save routines: Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
JavaScript errors: Check the browser console (F12 in most browsers, then select Console tab)
Responsive issues: Test on multiple devices and adjust CSS as needed

Understanding the Code
Recommendation Algorithm
The app uses a scoring system to match products to users:

Filters products based on skin type compatibility
Assigns higher scores to products that address primary concerns
Considers secondary concerns with lower weight
Factors in budget preferences
Selects the highest-scoring product for each routine step

This logic is in the findBestProduct() and scoreBestProduct() functions in app.js.
Local Storage
User selections and routines are saved in localStorage:
javascriptCopylocalStorage.setItem('kbeauty-routine', JSON.stringify({
  selections: userSelections,
  routine: generatedRoutine,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}));
This allows the app to remember user preferences between visits.
Future Enhancement Ideas

Add a "Favorites" feature to let users bookmark products
Implement product reviews or ratings
Include an ingredient dictionary
Add a feature to compare multiple routines
Implement seasonal routine adjustments
Create a printable PDF version
Add multilingual support
Enable routine sharing via URL parameters
Add dark mode support
Implement accessibility improvements
